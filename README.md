### Description

Formerly: IsPanel With Mouse Wheel Support

This is a complete rewrite of my original code posted here.

http://www.planetsourcecode.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=59863&lngWId=1

Similar to Java's JPanel this control allows you to add scroll bars to a form easily.

Supports Mouse Wheel, while tabbing through controls will keep the active control in current view.

DVBPanel is also now a container so no need to write any code in your form to support this control.

Works best as a compiled OCX however will run fine if just added to your application.
